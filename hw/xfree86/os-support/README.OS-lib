1 - Overview
------------
  This directory contains the OS support layer functions for the XFree86
servers.  In addition, some miscellaneous server support functions (not
OS-dependent) are included here, to take advantage of the fact that this
library comes last in the linking order.

Most of the functionality required to support a new OS is encapsulated in
this library.  It is hoped that all OS-specific details can be encapsulated,
but that is not likely ever to be completely possible.  Hence some minor
changes will wind up being made in other parts of the server.  The major
design principles for this library are maintainability, readability, and
portability.  Sometimes these goals conflict; some somewhat arbitrary choices
have been made in implementation.

2 - Directory Layout
--------------------
	os-support/	Contains headers and documentation; no code
		misc/	Non-OS-specific miscellaneous functions that
			fit best into the link architecture this way.
		shared/	Contains files with functions used by more than one
			OS.  These are symlinked into the OS subdirectories
			at build time via Imakefile rules.  This is alway
			preferable to reproducing functions in more than one
			OS library.
		amoeba/	OS support for the Amoeba operating system.
		bsd/	OS support for the 386BSD/NetBSD/FreeBSD operating 
			systems.
		bsdi/	OS support for the BSD/386 operating system.
		linux/	OS support for the Linux operating system.
		mach/	OS support for the Mach and OSF/1 operating systems.
		minix/	OS support for the Minix operating system.
		os2/	OS support for OS/2 2.11 and OS/2 Warp
		sco/	OS support for the SCO SVR3.x operating system.
		solx86/	OS support for the Solaris x86 operating system.
		sysv/	OS support for all SVR4.0 and SVR4.2, and for
			ISC and AT&T SVR3.2 operating systems.

3 - Adding A New OS
-------------------
  Adding a support for a new operating system entails implementing all of
the functions described in the API below.  Many of these functions are no-ops
for many operating systems, and appropriate files with dummy declarations are
available in the 'shared' subdirectory.

If your OS is sufficiently similar to an existing OS, you can make use of
the existing subdirectory.  One of the reasons for implementing this OS
library was the unmaintainability of the spagetti-#ifdef code that existed
before.  You should try to avoid cluttering the code with #ifdef's.  If
you find that the subdirectory is getting cluttered, split off into a
seperate subdirectory (e.g. as was done for SCO, rather than cluttering
the 'sysv' subdirectory).  You can split functions out of an existing
subdirectory into the 'shared' subdirectory, if that is appropriate.  Just
remember to update the Imakefile for the old subdirectory.

You will still likely have to make some small changes to other parts of
the server.  You should not put OS-specific #define's or #include's anywhere
else in the server.  These should all go in the "xf86_OSlib.h" header file
in this directory.
