 741. Some cleanups for the SCO support, and a few changes required for
      compilation on UnixWare (Bugzilla #1045, Kean Johnston).
 740. Make the X server lock file code treat the display string in the same
      way as the local listener code (i.e., convert it to an integer then back
      to a string).  This fixes a problem where an non-numeric display
      argument could cause a second server to be started on display :0,
      replacing the local listener nodes for the original server.
      (Bugzilla #1056, David Dawes, reported by Robin Schoonover).
 739. Fix xfs and xdm core dumps in BecomeOrphan(), and rework/simplify

      reboots, etc, and some odd xtest behaviour (David Dawes).
 725. Xdmcp fixes for IPv6 and mixed IPv6/IPv4 operation. (Mario Klebsch, 
      Matthieu Herrb).
 724. Update rman by merging XFree86 changes to rman 3.2 (Thomas Dickey).

      mapping (Ivan Pascal).
 
XFree86 4.3.99.901 ( 2 December 2003)
 645. Update xterm's checking of modifiers to match change 635, and handle
      the case of keys like Meta_L being in more than one modifier.  This
      addresses an issue arising from Bugzilla #924 (David Dawes).
 644. When XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 is used with IPv6 IPv4-mapped addresses,
      (which should not happen with change 643, but can be done with other 
      xdm implementations) send the IPv4 address in the auth data; otherwise

 638. Don't use IPv6 sockets with IPv4-mapped addresses (::FFFF:w.x.y.z)
      when making IPv4 connections with the "tcp" transport type.  This
      fixes problems on platforms (such as FreeBSD 5.1) which disable
      IPv4-mapped addresses by default.  It also fixes a problem with

      reported by Jonathan Hough).
 606. Add unmapping code to DGAUnmapPhysical() for most systems that use
      mmap().  Without this lots of map/unmap calls would result in running
      out of address space and/or file handles (Bugzilla #880, David Dawes,
      reported by Eckhard Neber).
 605. Restore the Windows keycodes in the 'xfree86' XKB keycodes map,

      slowness displaying on TrueColor visuals, and incorrectness displaying
      on DirectColor visuals) (David Dawes).
 595. Rank TrueColor above DirectColor in xwud.  This avoids colourmap flashing

       - Fix compiler warnings on Panther.
      (Torrey T. Lyons).
 574. A workaround for platforms (like *BSD) where IPv6 sockets don't accept
      IPv4 connections: disable IPv6 XDMCP code by default.  This allows IPv4
      XDMCP to work on such platforms (David Dawes).
 573. Rework REGION_* macros to eliminate NEED_SCREEN_REGIONS build failures
      (Marc La France).
 572. Fix an old bug in the X server and xfs related to usage of
      c->savedName (Bugzilla #818, Owen Taylor).

 568. The call to xf86RandRSetMode() from xf86RandRCreateScreenResources()
      doesn't appear to be necessary.  Removing it restores the documented
      ViewPort behaviour when RandR is enabled (David Dawes).
 567. Make the vesa driver blank the screen during initialisation for
      cosmetic reasons (David Dawes).
 566. Make the cirrus driver blank the screen during initialisation for
      cosmetic reaons (most other drivers do this) (Bugzilla #781,
      Nicholas Miell).
 565. The vesa driver wasn't setting the viewport correctly either at
      ScreenInit or EnterVT (David Dawes).
 564. Fix the viewport initialisation.  The ViewPort parameters from the
      XF86Config file were being ignored, and the default was a 0,0 viewport
      rather than centred on the virtual screen as documented.  When RandR
      is enabled, it undoes all of this though... (David Dawes).
 563. Fix an off-by-one bug in libXcursor that can result in segfaulting
      applications (David Dawes, reported by Agustin Gianni).
 562. Fix RandR initialization problem when default screen resolution is

XFree86 4.3.99.15 ( 1 November 2003)
 548. Update libfreetype-xtt2 to version 1.1:
       - Improved the very lazy method.  To prevent displaying chipped bitmap
         when having italic angle, the lsb and rsb are adjusted by using
         italicAngle in post table.
       - Added automatic correction of bitmap position for preventing
         displaying chipped bitmap when using charcell or very lazy method.
       - Set DEFAULT_VERY_LAZY macro.  If post table is available, the very
         lazy method is used as default when handling multi-bytes fonts.
       - Added additional glyphs(0x2d21-0x2d7c) to jisx0208.1990-0.enc.
      (Chisato Yamauchi, After X-TT Project).
 547. Set the pixel clock limit above which hzoom is enabled for the video
      overlay for G450 and G550 cards to 234MHz.  This fixes a problem with
      the Xv support having half horizontal resolution (Michel Lespinasse).
 546. Add support on Mac OS X for building keymap using Carbon Keyboard
      Layout API (John Harper).
 545. Map holes in kdrive VESA driver (#5436, Juliusz Chroboczek).

 532. Fix acecad input driver build and re-enable it 
      (Bugzilla #816, Alan Hourihane).
 531. Fix DRM_CAS on ia64 as used by the DRI (Bugzilla #778, John Dennis).
 530. Call OsCleanup() at the end of each server generation, and add an
      argument to indicate when the server is terminating.  This allows
      misc end-of-generation cleanups to be added to OsCleanup() (David Dawes).
 529. Explicitly free the DPMS and ScreenSaver timer resources at the end
      of each server generation (David Dawes).
 528. Cygwin configuration updates and install script updates (Bugzilla #799,

      Herrb).
 523. Fixes and updates for XKB keyboard maps:
      - Update Serbian layouts (Bugzilla #92, Danilo Segan).
      - Add 'MS Windows like' US International variant for 'us' keymap (Ivan
        Pascal).
      - Change CapsLock default behavior to 'Caps acts as locking Shift,
        Shift cancels Caps'.  Add new type for four-level keys (Ivan Pascal).
 522. Fix generic rootless code bug which tests CopyWindow instead of CopyBytes
      (Kensuke Matsuzaki).
 521. Update libfreetype-xtt2 to version 1.0c.  This consists of some minor
      fixes and cleanups (Chisato Yamauchi, After X-TT Project).
 520. Add accelerated rootless drawing support and fix bug in rootless
      FillSpans (Torrey T. Lyons and John Harper).

      - Clean up
      - Fix Xv problems after swsuspend
      - Fix LCD-via-CRT1 on various machines
 518. Prevent some compilers from optimising out Mesa's X11 error interface
      (Marc La France).
 517. Add rules to generate post-processed and assembler source from C++ files
      (Marc La France).
 516. Change `make World` so that well it interrupts itself to build a utility
      (makedepend, pswrap, etc), it only builds that utility.  Some things were
      being built too early (Marc La France).
 515. When the i830 driver's checks for sufficient memory for tiled mode
      fail, don't later try to allocate with tiling enabled (David Dawes).
 514. Enable I845G_VBE_WORKAROUND in the i830 driver for all platforms, since
      this reportedly fixes VT switching problems on hardware other than the
      845G.
 513. Updated README.SiS (Thomas Winischhofer).
 512. Add the After X-TT Project's libfreetype-xtt2 1.0b fixes and
      enhancements to the "freetype" module (Chisato Yamauchi,
      After X-TT Project).  This should make it possible to deprecate the
     "xtt" module in a future release.  Fixes and enhancements include:
       - Fixed crash caused by using fonts which have OS2 sfnt table.
       - Corrected metrics calculation error.  Although the original code uses
         size->metrics, the FT_Size_Metrics does not have exact values when
         handling the outline.  So the codes for metrics calculation were
         drastically rewritten.
       - Fixed some problems with FreeTypeRasteriseGlyph():
          + Made "only metrics is required" distinct from "both metrics and
            rasterised bitmap are required" to improve performance when
            loading large charset.
          + Fixed the erroneous usage of freetype2 API.  To get valid metrics,
            FT_Outline_Get_BBox() or FT_Outline_Get_CBox() is used for outline.
          + Took the strange code for raster copying and rewrote it.
       - Fixed UNDERLINE_POSITION so that it counts downwards.
       - Fixed a risky calculational method for info->maxbound and
         info->minbound when spacing is not charcell.  All glyphs' metrics are
         calculated and valid info->maxbounds and info->minbounds are set
         without cutting any corners.
       - Added TTCap option "fn","ai","ds","fs","vl","cr","bw","eb","hi",
         "fc" and "fm" which are compatible with X-TT 1.4.
       - Supported character width for vertical layouts.
 511. Encoding file updates (After X-TT Project):
       - Removed jisx0208.1983-0.enc and added 'ALIAS jisx0208.1983-0' to
         jisx0208.1990-0.enc.
       - Added Windows ucs2 cmap(3,1) to jisx0208.1990-0.enc and
         jisx0201.1976-0.enc.
       - Added files for GB18030-0 and GB18030-1 (James Su).
 510. Update X-TrueType (X-TT) to version 1.4.2 (Chisato Yamauchi,
      After X-TT Project):
       - Fixed several bugs of make_up_italic_bitmap() function.
       - Changed the order of priority of mapIDRelations in JISX0208 and
         JISX0201 code converter. The windows ucs2 is given the highest
         priority for kochi-substitute Japanese fonts.
       - Fixed code relation in cc_jisx0208_to_std_ucs2() function
         (not 0x215d -> 0x00b1 but 0x215d -> 0x2212)
       - Added minor improvements.
 509. Fixes and updates for HTML and PDF versions of spec docs for
      installation and inclusion in the online docs (David Dawes).
 508. Implement SharedLibtoolLibraryTarget, etc for bsdLib/ELF, including
      creating links for older but compatible revisions of such
      libraries (David Dawes).
 507. Allow a simple form of option name aliasing for options handled
      via OptionInfoRec (David Dawes).
 506. Add optimized code for RENDER with rootless XDarwin (John Harper,
      Torrey T. Lyons).
 505. Declare LoadPalette, SetOverscan and DPMSSet as public functions through
      the XFree86's ScrnInfoRec, so these functions can be wrapped.
      (Alan Hourihane).
 504. XDarwin improvements:
       - Add complete server side support for AppleWM with xpr.
       - Allow Aqua and X11 windows to interleave when AppleWM-aware window
         manager is present.
       - Fix hang on server reset.
      (Torrey T. Lyons, John Harper).
 503. Fix double-free at server regeneration in the screensave/DPMS timer
      code (David Dawes).
 502. Build most libraries as shared by default. (Matthieu Herrb, 
      David Dawes).

 500. Add 'inet' keymaps for two Logitec keyboard models (Bugzilla #762,
      Eric Mountain; Bugzilla #766, Chris Hornbaker) and cleanup Logitec
      keymaps (Ivan Pascal).
 499. Add missing SetScreenSaverTimer() to ProcSetScreenSaver (Ivan Pascal).
 498. Fix building on Mac OS X after DRI merge (Torrey T. Lyons).

XFree86 4.3.99.14 (10 October 2003)
 497. Add an xf86InitFBManagerLinear() function and implement the Linear
      allocation routines. These still fallback to XY area allocation if
      no (or the lack of) linear space is available. It assumes the driver
      has already called one of the init routines to the FBManager for Areas
      before this new setup can be used (Alan Hourihane).
 496. Added USB keyboard support for Solaris/x86 platform (Bugzilla #352,
      Daniel Rock).

        resized video RAM.
      * Fixed viewport/video overlay window alignment issues.
      * Fixed calculation of video overlay memory size.
      * Fixed video overlay on TV out (Bugzilla #213). (Egbert Eich).

      argument, not value in currentMode (Bugzilla #197, Egbert Eich).
 493. Added delay when writing to Glint PM2 ramdac to avoid lockups 
      (Egbert Eich).
 492. Fixed bug in Glint Bresenham line fallback code that caused line be drawn
      beyond framebuffer boundaries (Bugzilla #624, Egbert Eich).
 490. Force sane pallette when entering DGA mode in Matrox driver 
      (Egbert Eich).
 489. ATI Rage128: Wait with modifying FP video mode according to BIOS values
      until final call of ValidMode() to prevent modes from being rejected
      (Bugzilla #661, Egbert Eich).
 488. Some Savage BIOSes turn on clock doubling on non-doubled modes. 
      Added code that catches and fixes this situation (Egbert Eich).

      ScreenInit()/ CloseScreen().
      Fixed texture video support, removed artefacts in last line of overlay
      video support (Bugzilla #299). (Egbert Eich).
 486. Add "automatic configuration" support for the XFree86 server, allowing

         supplied configuration data.
       - Modify the algorithm for finding core input devices to maximise the
         likelihood that they will be found.
       - Add a FindDevice function to the OSMouse interface, allowing
         an OS-specific function to be called to find the mouse device when
         none is specified in the configuration.  Implementations included for
         Linux and FreeBSD.
       - Add a GuessProtocol function to the OSMouse interface, allowing
         an OS-specific function to be called as a fallback when the mouse
         protocol can't otherwise be detected.  Implementation included for
         Linux.
       - Bump the OSMouse interface version to 1.1 with the addition of the
         above two functions.
       - An interface for calling an external utility "getconfig" to generate
         some configuration data.  Implementation of getconfig included.
       - Generate a default internal configuration, autodetecting as much
         as possible, with reasonable fallbacks.
       - Recognise "DefaultDepth" and "DefaultFbbpp" options in the Device
         section.
       - Add a "TargetRefreshRate" option to help prevent modes with too
         high a resolution (and poor refresh rate) being used as the default.
       - Use DDC-probed mode timings to estimate the monitor parameters when
         the DDC-probed information doesn't include a DS_RANGES property.
         This should improve the reliability of monitor auto-detection.

      other NetBSD developers, Matthieu Herrb).
 451. For drivers that support 'Option "dri"' have the driver request
      loading the dri module when this option is true.  This brings
      it in to line with how other things are handled.  Other drivers
      that have DRI support need to have the "dri" option added (David Dawes).
 450. Fix libGL bug that could cause deadlock when switching contexts
      (John Harper).

 393. Change the XFree86 server's global default depth to 16, and change most
      drivers that support the three common depths (8, 16, 24) to defer to
      the global default rather than specifying their own (David Dawes).
 392. Fixed a crash when _XIMProtoOpenIM(), hich is called through XOpenIM()

      to xev to detect situations where this maps to a different keycode than
      the one of the key pressed (Egbert Eich).
 387. Made xauth called by startx quiet (Bugzilla #597, Stas Sergeev).
 386. Added missing operand size override handling to PUSH imm8 in x86emu
      (Bugzilla #590, Boris Weissman).

      X_LOCALE (Etsushi Kato).
 383. Update xev program for print the result of XmbLookupString call
      (Bugzilla #582, Noah Levitt, Ivan Pascal)
 382. Fixes and updates for XKB keyboard maps:
      - Fix for Uzbek keyboard map (Bugzilla #595, Mashrab Kuvatov).
      - Fix for the problem with Alt+Tab combinations in some window mangers
        (Bugzilla #580,616): window chooser menu doesn't disappear after
        Alt key release (Egbert Eich, Ivan Pascal).
 381. Allow a Display subsection with no depth or fbbpp specified to match
      any depth/fbbpp, and make Display subsections optional, creating one
      with default parameters when no suitable one can be found (David Dawes).
 380. Include <sys/param.h> to get the BSD macro for luit (ITO Tsuyoshi).

 362. Change the way xf86Build.h is created so that it doesn't cause its
      dependencies to be rebuilt when its contents are not changed
      (David Dawes).

XFree86 4.3.99.10 (10 August 2003)
 361. Fixes and updates for XKB keyboard maps:
      - Added numpad:microsoft XKB option (Bugzilla #558, Will Styles).
      - Fixed inconsistence in indicator names (Bugzilla #577, Noah Levitt).
      - Added type6 model of Sun keyboard (Warren Turkal).
 360. Add UK (gb) layout to the dvorak XKB map (#5739, Mike Sulivan).
 359. More work on the NativeGDI server for Cygwin/XFree86. The span routines
      are nearing completion (albeit they run slowly until the higher
      level X primitive functions are implemented). The obvious issue with
      the current code is the problems surrounding 1-bit DIBsections which
      have msb/lsb issues compared to the other types of DIBsections.
      This work was done quite some time ago in the Cygwin/XFree86 CVS.
      (Alan Hourihane).
 358. SiS driver update:
      - Added pseudo-Xinerama extension for MergedFB mode
      - Fixes for Clevo L285/L287 (1024x768)
 357. Include Xmd.h in Xpm/lib/XpmI.h to get definitions of LONG64 
      (Bugzilla #562, John Dennis).
 356. Moved Meta_L/R keys and added Super_L/R keys on macintosh keyboard.
      This makes the layout more compatible to the PC keyboard layout 
      (Bugzilla #565, Frank Murphy).
 355. Add check for Xmalloc() return value in XGetErrorDatabaseText() to avoid
      Sig11 (Bugzilla #563, Alan Coopersmith).
 354. Separated build of libglx.a module and normal libglx.a library 
      (Bugzilla #541, Frank Giessler).
 353. Fixed build of Xnest, Xprt and Xvfb for OS/2 by linking with the linker
      definition files (Bugzilla #541, Frank Giessler).
 352. Fixed freeing of properties form xkb_geomerty block (Bugzilla #550, 
      Alexander Pohoyda).
 351. Fixed string octal number parsing and string to int conversion for "\00"
      in xkbcomp (Bugzilla #553, Egbert Eich).
 350. Removed stale definition from XftCompat.h (Bugzilla #543, Egbert Eich).
 349. Added XLC_LOCALE file for zh_CN.UTF-8, moved iso10646 encoding to the end
      in ja_JP, ko_KR and zh_TW UTF-8  XLC_LOCALE files 
      (Bugzilla #544, Akira TAGOH).

      Frank Murphy).
 345. Add new charset sequence for CText at the end of list. This way the
      sequence of a charsets that were added earlier will be picked if two
      sequences for the same charset are registered (Bugzilla #228, 
      Egbert Eich).
 344. Use return value sysconf (_SC_OPEN_MAX) instead of the fixed number 256
      for allowed number of open files on POSIX.1 conformant systems
      (Egbert Eich).
 343. Added missing exported functions in libfreetype to compile mkfontscale,
      made mkfontsdir script install on platforms that use extensions (Bugzilla
      536, Frank Giessler).
 342, Fixed a sig11 in Xaw that may appear on the rare condition that no font
      can be found (Bugzilla #482, Egbert Eich).
 341. Added KP_Separator to symbols that can generate decimal() in xcalc
      (Egbert Eich).
 340. Disabled Color8x8PatternFill() in savage driver (Egbert Eich).

      - Starting two copies of Xine no longer aborts the X server
      - Added support for KM400/K8M400
      - Improved video overlay support.
      - Fixed video overlay clipping when the image cliprects change but 
	not the size.
      - TV tuner support via XV interface for two overlay ports.
      - DRI support (the client side library is not yet fully ported to 4.3).
      - Disable Xv in modes with insufficient bandwidth (1600c1200x16).
      - Updated documentation
	It differs from the base VIA codedrop.
      - Several of the fixes were done by me on top of it (the dual Xine fix,
	and bandwidth)
      - Various system types have been turned to CARD32 to make the code 
	portable
      - The hybrid Video4Linux/XV glue was racy and has been removed 
	(the XV layer is more than sufficient anyway)
      - DRI library client code is not included (porting not yet finished)
      - Additional debugging
        (Bugzilla #525, VIA, Alan Cox) .
      - Cleaning up namespace pollution, removing dependency on via_drm.h
	removing some global symbols from driver (Egbert Eich).
        Please note: there are more global symbols yet to be removed.
 335. Remove the 'xc/xkbcomp/geometry/HP' directory from the CVS repository.
 334. Substantial rewrite of the "nv" driver (Mark Vojkovich).
 333. Resync with Cygwin/XFree86 changes up to Test92 (#5721, Harold Hunt and
      the Cygwin/XFree86 project).
 332. Add a clean target for Cygwin's ResourceObjectRule() rule (#5720,
      Harold Hunt).
 331. Fix xman's formatting/displaying of manual pages on Darwin, where
      'groff' defaults to PostScript formatting (#5719, T. M. Pederson).
 330. SiS driver update:
       - Fixed SiS 620 support
       - Added interface for sisctrl utility
      (Thomas Winischhofer)
 329. Fixes for regressions in xauth and xhost with IPv6 code
      (Matthieu Herrb, Hideki ONO). 
 328. Update X-TrueType (X-TT) to version 1.4.1 (Chisato Yamauchi,
      After X-TT Project):
       - Extension of code converter modules for ARABIC, ARMSCII8,
         BIG5HKSCS, GB18030, ISO8859.*, etc. (Pablo Saratxaga, James Su)
       - Try to use TT_Load_Glyph_Bitmap() in get_metrics() when `bs'
         option is not set.
       - Use Embedded Bitmap with the option `eb=y' when Auto Italic is set.
       - Enhancements for `ds', `eb' and `bw' options.
       - New options for TTCap, `fc' and `fm': they enable the *extremely*
         fast loading of big Japanese or unicode fonts with `-p-' in the XLFD.
       - Performance improvement of FreeTypeGetMetrics() function.
       - Improved performance based on the solution to the buffer
         overflow problem, caused by exceeding the range of
         maxbounds.ascent/maxbounds.descent.  This problem occurred only
         when `-m-' spacing was used.
       - Improved fix to crashes caused when certain fonts (e.g. verdana.ttf)
         are used; solution based on investigating the true nature of the
         problem.
       - Added patch for mktcapdir-0.5.4 and some ttfconf files suitable for
         X-TT 1.4.0.
       - Preparation for extending the encoding field of XLFD.  X-TT permits
         the following additional XLFD format:
            "-foo-foo-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-c-0-foo.2000-0.0"
            "-foo-foo-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-c-0-foo.2000-0.1"
         The last number can be used to indicate the plane number of a huge
         character set.
       - Support for reverse `fc' specification. `fc=0xaa00-0xa0ff' means
         specifying the ranges 0x0000-0xa0ff and 0xaa00-0xffff.  This is
         useful for GB18030 proportional fonts.
       - Improved fix for server crash that appears on Linux/PPC.
       - Added ksc5601.*-3 and ksx1001.*-3 to KSCJOHAB/main.c (Jungshik Shin).
       - Added U+20AC and U+00AE characters to KSCJOHABtoUCS2.c and
         KSC5601toUCS2.c (Jungshik Shin).
       - Fixed an X server crash when using LucidaSansRegular.ttf
         (reported by Koike Kazuhiko).
       - Improved fix to prevent NULL dereference when the font cache
         becomes full; solution by allocation of a dummy area for bitmap.
       - Fixed an X server crash because of an inconsistency problem between
         XFree86 and X-TT (reported by Koike Kazuhiko).
       - Numerous minor improvements.

XFree86 4.3.99.9 (25 July 2003)
 327. Add Mach64 I2C framework.  Derived from GATOS project (Marc La France).
 326. Removed ru_yawerty xkb symbols file as it is misleading as suggested
      by Ivan Pasacal (Bugzilla #516, Ivan Pascal).
 325. Fixed two bounds errors in rman 
      (Bugzilla #505, Dan Nelson, Bugzilla #506,  Eric Anholt).
 324. Cleaned up MMIO map/unmap in RADEONPreInit(), unmapped MMIO in 
      CloseScreen() even when server is switched away (Bugzilla #504, 
      Hui Yu, Egbert Eich).
 323. Modified transport code so that a bind to an IPv4 socket fails silently
      when the bind to an IPv6 socket for the same port was successful.
      This works around a problem in theIPv6 implementation on some OSes
      that also handle IPv4 calls over IPv6 sockets (Egbert Eich).
 322. Simplified handling of the -nolisten option as suggested by 
      Alan Coopersmith. This option can now be issued multiple times.
 321. Added code to unmap sysMem when freeing int10 (Bugzilla #504, 
      Frank Giessler).
 320. Fix generic rootless crash while resizing when CopyBytes is not defined
      by the implementation (Torrey T. Lyons).
 319. Fix XDarwin Cocoa rootless crash when unshaping a shaped window
      (Torrey T. Lyons).
 318. More IPv6 changes from Alan Coopersmith as follows:
      - Add support for IPv6 bracketed numeric addresses, similar to RFC 2732
        syntax to a number of areas.
      - Fix some issues with colon parsing and determining which addresses are
        DECnet (two colons between hostname and display number) and which are
        non-bracketed IPv6 numeric addresses ending in two colons, followed by
        another colon and the display number (three colons in a row).
      - Fix additional places Fabio forgot to change the string length when
        switching "inetv6" to "inet6".
      - Use MAXHOSTNAMELEN if it is defined for MAXHOSTNAME in xrdb.  (Perhaps
        NI_MAXHOST should be used as well on platforms that support it.)
      - Make #include <sys/socket.h> in Xtrans.h look like the other places
        it's included in the tree, with checks for Lynx & Win32
 317. IPv6:  2003.07.11 update to X.Org's response to comment #13;  i.e.
      s/FamilyInternetV6/FamilyInternet6/g  (Marc La France).
 316. IPv6 build fixes for older Linux systems;  Many of these are derived from
      a suggestion by Alan Coopersmith (Marc La France).
 315. Change DEVID macro to work around glitch in SCO's C compiler
      (Marc La France).
 314. Fixed Radeon driver so that clone modes survive server reset 
      (Bugzilla #487, Egbert Eich).
 313. Changed behavior of FreeType and Type1 renderer: when no encoding file
      is found fail with BadFontName instead of using an iso8859-1 encoding
      (Bugzilla #479, Roland Mainz, Juliusz Chroboczek, Egbert Eich).
 312. Fixed screen switching problem on SCO where VT was off by one 
      (Bugzilla #470, Kean Johnston).
 311. S3 driver:
      . allow only specific displayWidths when acceleration is enabled 
      . added double_scan support (Egbert Eich).
 310. Removed build rules for hp Xserver that was recently removed from 
      Xserver/Imakefile (Egbert Eich).
 309. Fixes for C&T driver: 
      . switch to SW mouse in doublescan modes.
      . centered video correctly for all interlaced modes (docs were
        misleading).
      . fixed README (Egbert Eich).
 308. Fixed a typo in mkfontscale (Bugzilla #491, Juliusz Chroboczek).
 307. A lot of X server prototype cleanups, including fixing an
      inconsistency between the cfbBitBlt and CopyPlane functions 
      exposed by the prototyping (#A.1859, Alexander Stohr).
 306. Fix missing newline in Message -> MessageF transition in dri_glx.c
      (#A.1833, Alexander Stohr).

XFree86 4.3.99.8 (10 July 2003)
 300. X.Org IPv6 changes (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith, Marc La France).
      See http://www.x.org/IPV6_Specific_Changes.html for details.  This has
      been further modified as follows.
      - Deal with small memory leaks in xdm & xauth.
      - Fix a number of compilation issues.
      - Where supported, use SIOCGLIFCONF to query network interfaces on more
        than only Solaris.
      - Incorporate X.Org responses to comments #'s 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12,
        13, 14 and 15 (taken from an X.Org-internal document dated 2003.06.17).
      - Replace HasIPv6 imake symbol with BuildIPv6, defaulting it to YES, and
        build in IPv6 support whenever BuildIPv6 is asserted _and_ the OS
        #define's AF_INET6.  This is to maximise IPv6 code exposure and
        eliminate <OS>.cf file changes to support IPv6.
 299. On Solaris, don't allow remote root xdm logins if CONSOLE is set in
      /etc/default/login (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).

      lost (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 296. Make certain xtrans static variable volatile to avoid optimisation issues
      that occur when they are modified by SIGALRM handlers
      (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 295. Use %p instead of %x to print pointer values in xtrans debug messages to
      avoid overflow on platforms with 32-bit ints & 64-bit pointers
      (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 294. Change SUN-RPC code to use authdes_seccreate() call rather than the
      deprecated authdes_create() (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 293. Add xdm /dev/random handling for Solaris
      (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 292. Solaris compile fixes (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 291. Update X.Org version numbers to X11R6.6 or X11R6.7 and replace old
      references to X Consortium with X.Org (Bugzilla #227, Alan Coopersmith).
 290. Update the usage of DRM AGP handles so that valid handles aren't
      mis-interpreted as invalid handles (based on Bugzilla #484, Dave Airlie).
 289. Twisting fontfile.c and fontdir.c to be able to pass all fonts (bitmap
      and scaleable) to the scalable renderer as this one can deal with 
      XLFD names (Bugzilla #475, Juliusz Chroboczek). PLEASE TEST!
 288. Changing PS/2 mouse resolution to 8 counts/mm as some broken mice have
      problems with other values (W. uses 8) (Egbert Eich).
 287. Fixing mode setting by BIOS. Wrong clock selection in MiscOut register
      caused screen to stay blank (Egbert Eich).
 286. Added description for -dumpSched and -schedInterval to the usage
      message (Egbert Eich)
 285. Update the SCO OpenServer port, fixing these specific problems:
        . Fixed the Imake template so i[3456]86 and friends arent defined
        . Fixed bad preprocessor stuff in X11.tmpl that was producing warnings
        . Updated default GCC flags to more aggresively optimize
        . Fixed keyboard LED handling
        . Enable SCO function keys in xterm
        . Make Delete key send  DEL by default on SCO in xterm
        . Fix to make fonttosfnt compile (Bugzilla #470, Kean Johnston).
 284. Added missing ro2 symbols file to list of files to install 
      (Bugzilla #476, Egbert Eich).
 283. Corrected precedence problem in test in xc/lib/X11/XKBUse.c:
      XkbUseExtension(). This avoids an extra round trip during application
      startup (Bugzilla #473, Owen Taylor).
 282. Fixing deadlock in libXi - when is called _XLockDisplay() twice - when 
      calling a Xi function that calls XGetExtensionVersion() (Bugzilla #260,
      Bastien Nocera, Owen Taylor). 
 281. Adding support for video modes <320x240 to S3 driver by changing the 
      minimal clock frequency to 15.6 MHz (Bugzilla #472, Alexey Baj).
 280. Made mkfontscale behavior and options compatible to mkfontdir, fixed
      bugs in output format (Bugzilla #425, Juliusz Chroboczek, Kean Johnston).
 279. Changed xclock hands back to black (antialiased) , created XClk-col.ad
      to set colored hands instead, added missing documentation for missing
      resources. This follows the behavior of the other X applications more
      closely (Bugzilla #437, Joerg Wunsch).
 278. Added support for Trio64UV+ and Trio64V2/DX/GX to S3 driver (backport
      from 3.x) (Bugzilla #465, Alexej Baj).
 277. Increased Xlib default buffer size to 16k (was 2048), made size 
      configurable thru environment variable XLIBBUFFERSIZE (minimum 2048)
      (Bugzilla #466, Roland Mainz).
 276. Increased maximum BIGREQUEST size to 4Mb and made it configurable thru
      a command line option. This increases performance of certain 
      applications considerably (Bugzilla #460, Roland Mainz).
 275. VIA driver: initialized screen parameters in PreInit() instead of
      AccelInit() so that they are set even when acceleration is disabled
      (Egbert Eich).
 274. Do not drop H&V sync during screen blanking for Radeon
      (Bugzilla #320, Michael Breuer, Hui Yu@ATI).
 273. Let out-of-limit pixel clocks only use the frequency below pll output
      lower limit for Radeons (Bugzilla #262, John Vickers, Hui Yu@ATI).
 272. Add support for Radeon cards with DAC/TMDS wire up in different ways
      from what the driver was originally programmed to; includes support
      for dual DVI cards (Hui Yu@ATI).
 271. Add Radeon DPMS handling for flat panels (Bugzilla #26, Hui Yu@ATI).
 270. Decreased the retry loops in DDC probing so that Radeon startup
      time won't be too long in the worst case (Hui Yu@ATI).
 269. Fix Radeon Asic bug in RMX unit of IGP chips (Hui Yu@ATI).
 268. Fix Radeon register initialization for RGB offset to fix the
      "milky-screen" problem (Bugzilla #351, Hui Yu@ATI).
 267. Add support for new Radeon chips: R350(9800), RV350(9600,M10),
      RS250(IGP7000), RS300(IGP9000), RV280(9200) (Hui Yu@ATI).
 266. Fix a lockup with the trident driver when stopping/starting Xv
      applications (Alan Hourihane).
 265. Fix initialisation in xauth (Martin Birgmeier).
 264. Calling RADEONSaveFPRegisters() regardless of display type to catch
      register restauration problems (Bugzilla #193, Hui Yu).
 263. Fixed order of name and filename in encodings.dir files generated by
      mkfontscale (Roland Mainz).
 262. Changed resource registration in TDFX driver: VGA mem resources
      are unused during OPERATING state, RAC isn't required for memory
      resources (Bugzilla #357, Egbert Eich).
 261. Attempt to fix VIA driver lockups when moving windows:
      assumed bug compatibility to previous S3 products 
      (Bugzilla #435, Egbert Eich).
 260. Disabled mode writeback to client program from MGA driver (Egbert Eich).
 259. #ifdef'ed variables in os-support/bsd in cases they are not needed
      (Bugzilla #430, Jason L. Wright).
 258. Fixes and updates for XKB keyboard maps:
      - add Faroese keyboard map (Bugzilla #401, Roi a Torkilsheyggi)
      - add missing KPPT key to ABNT2 keycodes list (Bugzilla #431, Christian
        Tosta)
      - fix geometry/pc file (Alexander Pohoyda).
 257. Don't sleep on Darwin for directory owner/mode problems (John Harper).
 256. Limit 430TX and 430VX to 128 and 32 PCI buses respectively

      (see #233) (Bugzilla #388, Juliusz Chroboczek).
 250. Added encoding files for Arabic (iso8859-6.16 and iso8859-6.8x)
      (Bugzilla #420, Roland Mainz).
 249. Removed O_SYNC from open call for /dev/mem for all Linux platforms.
      This hopefully takes care of the speed problem

	 and returned with the & operator.  This location is further
	 suspect of variable size problems on anything else but 32 bit
	 platforms, with the new code it might more likely raise a type

      Mike Harris).
 950. Restore the radeon driver's unconditional RADEONPreInt10Save() call
      on Alpha platforms because this is needed for Radeon cards where the
      BIOS ROM can't be read after it's been run once (by the firmware)
      without this (#5648, Jeff Wiedemeier).
 949. Update Newport driver doc (#5647, Guido Guenther).
 948. Fix reversed logic for VGA locking/unlocking (Nat Ersoz).
 947. Luit fixes:

      Theppitak Karoonboonyanan).
 932. Replace xf86setjmp/xf86setlongjmp with symbol aliases that resolve
      directly to the native libc versions so that they can operate in
      modules, and make xf86jmp_buf much larger so that should be big enough
      for any reasonable CPU/OS combination.  This should fix problems
      with the Freetype2-based freetype font module (#A.1625, Keith Packard).
 931. Change the default base symbols map from pc104 to pc105, which should
      fix most cases where the <LSGT> key isn't defined.  Also change the

      bounds check failures (Keith Packard).
 918. Check that the HW cursor has been setup before calling
      xf86ForceHWCursor() in the radeon (and r128) driver.  This fixes

      lockup in KDE (#5619, Ewald Snel).
 903. Fix some bugs with Xft drawing to non-Render enabled servers:
       - Drawing monochrome glyphs had an infinite loop.
       - XftGlyphSpecCore failed to render some glyphs, leading to application
         crashes from uninitialized values.
       (#A.1608, Keith Packard, reported by Nalin Dahyabhai).
 902. Fix the <BKSL> key in the "winkeys" variants of the Russian and
      Ukrainian XKB maps (#5624, Leon Kanter).

      (Leif Delgass).
 897. Fix the behaviour of XLookupString() when XKB is enabled in Xlib
      but not the server.  This fixes an xtest XRebindKeysym() failure

      (#5621, Michel Dänzer).
 895. Fix the return value of SetFontPath() when a font path element is bad
      (David Dawes).

 888. Cure cursor artifacts by setting HARDWARE_CURSOR_SHOW_TRANSPARENT and
      HARDWARE_CURSOR_UPDATE_UNHIDDEN in the r128 and radeon drivers.  The
      wait-for-VSync nonsense the Radeon's currently do can, and should, be
      ripped out later.  (Marc La France).
 887. Extend HARDWARE_CURSOR_SHOW_TRANSPARENT to make hardware cursors
      transparent, rather than disabling them, when a switch to a software
      cursor is needed.  This removes recently introduced cursor artifacts
      in the atimisc driver.  (Marc La France).
 886. Cancel repeat for switch screen XKB actions, which fixes a VT
      switching problem that has just become visible (Ivan Pascal).
 885. Added reinitialization of screen layout after RandR size change
      on a multihead setup. This keeps cursor movement beween screens
      working (Egbert Eich).

      like the slightly different resulting colour definitions from the
      Xcms.txt entries were responsible for an xtest failure.
 883. Fix some problems with using pre-existing version of fontconfig,
      freetype2 and expat (#A.1600, Keith Packard).

 675. Fix some problems with the addition of multi-layout scheme to
      xkb: some keys that aren't 'alphabetic' should be treated as

 343. New Xwin server code from the Cygwin/XFree86 project.  This version
      is more portable across Win32 platforms.  Changes include:
       - Use fb and shadowfb, and use the faster of GDI blitter,
         DirectDraw blitter and DirectDraw4 blitter to update damaged
         regions.  The video card's framebuffer is no longer mapped.
       - Works correctly at depths > 8, but colors are not correct at depth 8.
       - Uses the standard Win32 API messages for processing keyboard and
         mouse input rather than using DirectInput.  This is more reliable.
       - Improved internal structure and coding conventions.
       - Builds completely from the XFree86 tree using gcc (the Visual C++
         compiled xf_dx.dll is no longer used).
       - The new server can run on machines that don't have DirectDraw/DirectX
         installed (or installed but not operable) by falling back to the
         GDI blitter.  The best drawing interface is determined at startup,
         but this can be overriden with the -engine command line option.
       - The Xrender extension is now supported.
       - Command line option is available to run in full screen mode.

      (#4478, Theppitak Karoonboonyanan).
 216. Update ucs2any.pl, and replace the special map-* files with the

       - A bug has been fixed that caused sometimes the FONT property not
         to be updated correctly.
       - The FONTBOUNDINGBOX is now recalculated, which makes the script
         also suitable for proportional fonts.
       - The mapping table for the DEC VT100 graphic characters is now built

1085. -
1084. Bump the minor revisions of libXmu (UTF8_STRING) and libX11
      (Xutf8LookupString).
1083. Fixes for all known bugs in the CompoundText parser and generator,
      including:
       * While adding a charset:
         - Adding a charset with two different escape sequences (e.g.
           ISO-8859-14) led to broken behaviour of the converter. Moreover
           the second added would have priority over the first added.
         - If an invalid escape sequence was detected by _XlcParseCharSet, it
           was still used when generating compound text.
         - Extended segment charsets with varying number of bytes per character
           were treated like those with 1 byte per character.
         - _XlcAddCT failed to copy its ct_sequence argument, thus leading to
           bugs when this argument was a dynamically allocated string.
         - Missing detection of different charsets having the same escape
           sequence.
       * Parsing Compound Text:
         - The functions _XlcParseCT and _XlcGetCTInfo did not perform range
           checks on the strings being parsed. Danger of core dump through
           out-of-bounds string access if a malicious client provides malformed
           text.
         - Builtin extended segment charsets were not recognized because the
           strncmp in _XlcGetCTInfo was returning false most of the time, due
           to the embedded length bytes.
         - Extended segment charsets in general would not be deactivated after
           the specified number of bytes.
         - In _XlcCheckCTSequence, extended segments with invalid embedded
           length bytes would lead to out-of-bounds string accesses as well.
         - Unrecognized escape sequences did not lead to a return value > 0.
         - Left-to-right and right-to-left indicators (starting with 0x9b) were
           just ignored, without leading to a return value > 0.
         - If the source string was larger than the intermediate buffer,
           multibyte characters could be split into pieces, leading to
           conversion errors.
       * Generating Compound Text:
         - The length embedded in an extended segment prefix was always wrong.
         - Long strings could give rise to extended segments with a length that
           doesn't fit in the allowed 14 bits.
         - After an extended segment, GL or GR designators would unnecessarily
           be repeated.
         - Bytes in the range 0x81..0x88, 0x8b..0x9a, 0x9c..0x9f in multibyte
           encodings could not be output, would be thrown away.
         - Byte 0x9b could not be output in the UTF-8 charset.
       * udcInf.c was generating invalid Compound Text (invalid length in
         extended segment).
       * lcConv.c: If in the indirect converter, the first step led to no
         output, the second step would still be called, possibly leading to
         out-of-bounds accesses.
       * lcUTF8.c: had knowledge about JISX0208.1983-0 but not about
         JISX0208.1990-0.

        runs with XF86Config's that specify no mode information whatsoever.
      - Implement minHeight and maxHeight checks.

      - Documentation updates.
      - Minor fixes to C&T and GLINT drivers.
3271. ATI driver updates (Marc La France).
      - Disallow interlaced modes when scanline pitch exceeds hardware limits.
      - LCD support no longer depends on the mode on server entry.

2192. Fix a FreeType build problem on 64-bit platforms (#2411, Alan Hourihane).
2191. Fix a cfb24 build problem that shows up with egcs (#2410,
      Alan Hourihane).
2190. Add DPMS, DDC1 and HW cursor support to the SiS driver, and fix panning
      in the SiS driver (#2409, Alan Hourihane).
2189. Put copyright notices from the pandix/panmi code into the merged
      dix/mi versions (#2408, Alan Hourihane).
2188. Update drivers to use the 24/32 conversion layer, and to default to
      a 24bpp framebuffer format when supported.
2187. Make some refinements to the way the depth 24 pixmap format is set.
2186. Replace the ModuleInit function with a ModuleData data object.  This
      allows the loader to get the version and entry points from a module
      without first executing module code.
2185. Unify the abiclass and abivendor fields of XF86ModuleVersionInfo,
      and add a moduleclass field.

2174. Fix an 8+32 layer bug introduced in 3.9Nw (#2398, Mark Vojkovich).
2173. Add a 32/24 conversion layer.  Pixmaps are still 24bpp internally,
      but the interfaces visible to clients are all 32bpp (#2397,
      Mark Vojkovich).
2172. Fix trident driver panning at 24bpp (#2395, Alan Hourihane).
2171. Add DDC1 and DDC2 (the latter not working yet) to the trident driver

      necessary (#2394, David Bateman).
2164. Add some sanity checking for the subdirs argument to LoadSubModule, etc.
2163. Fix a bug in the verbose Mode handling in the parser that can result
      in an infinite loop when the "Mode" keyword is used incorrectly in
      a config file.
2162. Add a global default module path to the loader, and a function that
      the common layer can call to set it.
2161. LoadModule was ignoring the subdir list argument (Nozomi Ytow).
2160. Add printing of subsystem ids to scanpci (Dirk Hohndel).

XFree86 3.9Nw (17 January 1999)

      given depth, and fix a crash in xf86ValidateModes() caused by recent
      changes in this area.
2158. Add an extra argument to LoadSubModule (and LoadModule) to allow the
      caller to optionally specify version and/or ABI requirements that
      the loaded module must meet for the load to complete successfully.
2158. Add support to the loader for vendor-defined ABI classes.  These classes
      are specified as a string.  The main use is for third party modules that
      themselves load sub-modules (like X-TT).
2157. Fix the MGA driver's handling of the "MGA_SDRAM" option.  SDRAM cards
      are still not auto-detected though (#2391, Mark Vojkovich).

      and enable the faster linear expansions instead of the planar ones
      (#2390, Mark Vojkovich).

2154. Export some missing symbols for Alpha platforms (#2388, Alan Hourihane).
2153. Fix a bug in determing the card type in the TGA driver (#2387,
      Alan Hourihane).

      related config file keywords are no longer used.  New flags and options
      have been added to specify the server-wide depth 24 pixmap format.
      A "standard" set of pixmap formats is always advertised, so drivers
      using these don't need to worry about explicitly adding them.
2141. Fix some sun_path overflows in xtrans.
2140. Some panoramix fixups (#2376, Alan Hourihane).
2139. Don't allow arbitrarily long display number strings to be passed on
      to xtrans by _X11TransConnectDisplay().
2138. Update the parser and xf86Config.c to allow Options to be specified in
      the config file's ServerLayout section.  Options in the ServerLayout
      section can override those in the ServerFlags section.
2137. Update the parser and xf86Config.c to allow "Inactive" devices
      to be specified in the config file's ServerLayout section.
2136. Import xpm version 3.4k.

2117. Fix a bug in the xterm man page (#2333, Thomas Dickey).
2116. Remove the -fno-strength-reduce option for OpenBSD and NetBSD (#2328,
      Matthieu Herrb).
2115. Import regex for systems that don't have a Posix regex.
2114. Add a LoaderListDir() function that can be used to list the available
      modules.
2113. Modify LoadModule and LoadSubmodule to accept optional subdir and
      pattern lists, and use regular expressions for the module matching
      instead of prefix/suffix lists.
2112. Add a "revpath" utility to xc/config/util to help in dealing with
      imake's use of relative paths.  If this proves to be useful, it could
      be used more widely in imake's rules.
2111. Install some classes of modules into subdirectories of the "modules"
      directory.  The imake module install rules have been updated
      accordingly.

      function since it is already available from the FbAreaPtr (#2286,
      Mark Vojkovich).

      window to be generated from a program run on the target host.  This
      allows information like number of users, load average, etc to be
      displayed (like CDE does) (#2275, Dick Snippe).
2035. Fix a core dump problem in xauth when interrupted while attempting
      to lock the auth file.  Also fix a potential problem with calling
