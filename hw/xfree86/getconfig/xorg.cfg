# Rules.  Rules consist of a condition (in perl code) followed by
# a driver name and optionally some additional strings.  The start of a
# rule is indicated by a line with no leading white space.  subsequent
# lines making up a rule must be indented.  Logical lines may be split
# over multiple physical lines by using the usual continuation '\'.
#
# Rules that are not followed by a driver name may be used to do other
# things, like setting the weight as above.
